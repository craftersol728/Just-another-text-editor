Start by creating a client-server folder structure for your application, which includes a client folder for your frontend code and a server folder for your backend code.

Use npm to install any necessary dependencies for your application, such as idb and webpack.

Write your backend code, which includes implementing methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database using idb.

Write your frontend code, which should include a text editor interface that allows users to enter and save text to the IndexedDB database.

Bundle your JavaScript files using webpack, and configure webpack plugins to generate an HTML file, a service worker, and a manifest file.

Use next-gen JavaScript features to improve the functionality and efficiency of your application.

Test your application to ensure that it functions properly, including saving and retrieving content from the IndexedDB database and caching static assets.

Add a feature to allow users to download and install your application as an icon on their desktop.

Use workbox to register a service worker that pre-caches your static assets and subsequent pages.

Finally, deploy your application to Heroku using proper build scripts for a webpack application.
